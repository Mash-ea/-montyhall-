Description: When mathematical calculations are tedious, A reliably     effective and efficient way to tackle these analytical snags is to code a program to solve it for us. We achieve this by creating a simulation program that allows us to play the game a thousand times recording the results for the two strategies- staying with the initial door or switching. Switching is deemed superior.
